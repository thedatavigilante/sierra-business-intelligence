## 📊 Real Findings (from live data, May 2021 – May 2026)

### Search-Interest Leaders (5-Year Average)
1. **Amazon** — 72.0 (sustained baseline leader)
2. **crypto** — 37.0 (volatile but persistently high)
3. **Netflix** — 30.3 (steady entertainment demand)
4. **AI** — 28.8 (accelerating since 2023)
5. **ChatGPT** — 26.6 (explosive entry in 2023, stabilizing)

### YoY Growth Winners (Last 52 Weeks vs Prior)
| Topic | YoY Growth |
|-------|-----------|
| **AI** | +70.7% |
| **inflation** | +68.9% |
| **mental health** | +62.5% |
| **crypto** | +50.5% |
| **machine learning** | +50.0% |

### YoY Decliners
| Topic | YoY Change |
|-------|-----------|
| **Bitcoin** | −21.7% |
| **recession** | −7.1% |
| **Amazon** | −5.7% |
| **ChatGPT** | −0.4% |
| **Tesla** | +4.2% |

### Key Trend Patterns
- **AI** remains the dominant search topic with current interest at 67 (week of 2026-05-17), up +70.7% YoY. AI and ChatGPT are tightly correlated (r ≈ 0.96), confirming they move as a single conversational cluster.
- **ChatGPT** has stabilized at ~50–60 after its 2023 peak (82), down slightly (−0.4% YoY) but maintaining a permanently elevated plateau vs pre-launch baseline.
- **inflation** surged +68.9% YoY and hit an all-time high of 41 in early 2025, now cooling to 14 but still elevated vs historical baseline.
- **crypto** rebounded +50.5% YoY with current interest at 41, decoupling somewhat from Bitcoin (−21.7% YoY) — suggesting retail interest in "crypto" as a category exceeds specific asset curiosity.
- **mental health** is the quiet breakout: +62.5% YoY with low absolute volume (current: 2), indicating an early-growth niche with compounding potential.
- **Netflix** and **Amazon** are both flat-to-slow-decline (−5.7% for Amazon, +4.8% for Netflix), suggesting category maturation or competition erosion in streaming/e-commerce.
- **Tesla** is flat (+4.2% YoY) at low absolute interest (5), suggesting the topic has passed peak novelty and entered steady-state awareness.
- **recession** searches are down −7.1% YoY and decoupled from inflation (r ≈ 0.39 vs historical 0.75), indicating public concern has shifted from macro fears to specific price pressures.

## Figure Gallery

### Search Trends Overview

![Search Interest](figures/01_exploratory_analysis_figure_001.png)
*AI is in its own category now — it's not "tech" anymore. Worldwide search interest shows AI's divergence from every other topic since 2023. This is structural growth, not a hype cycle.*

![YoY Growth](figures/01_exploratory_analysis_figure_004.png)
*Three stories in one chart: AI boom (+70.7%), inflation peak (+68.9% before cooling), mental health shift (+62.5%).*  

### Geographic & Breakout Intelligence

![Regional Map](figures/03_executive_dashboard_figure_002.png)
*California and New York drive tech-topic search — but the Midwest is catching up. US regional choropleth with state-level interest scores.*

![Breakout Alerts](figures/03_executive_dashboard_figure_003.png)
*Spot emerging trends before they hit headlines. "AI" spawns "AI art," "AI detector," "AI jobs" — early signals of where attention is migrating.*
